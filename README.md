# Advanced Lane Finding
This project was forked from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines), it is part of the [Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) course projects.

## Overview
In this project, I used computer vision techniques like edge detection, perspective transform, camera calibration ... to detect highway lane informations (e.g. position, curvature ...) using pure camera data.

## The Project
* Project report in [writeup_report.md](./writeup_report.md)
* Video pipeline source code in [P4.ipynb](./P4.ipynb)
* Saved camera calibration matrix at distort_mtx.p
* Result at results.mp4

### The result looks like this
